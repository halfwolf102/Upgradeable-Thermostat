## Description
This mod makes thermostats upgradeable, breakable, and includes three upgrades:

### TEMPERATURE SENSOR
- The temperature sensor allows thermostats to run automatically and set its temperature based on the weather
- It requires level 7 handiness, as well as 2 common upgrades parts, and 3 electronic upgrade parts (or 5 eco upgrade parts if you have Eco Lifestyle).
- This is automatically unlocked for apartments, rental lots, and all lots your household doesn't own.
- Automatic is set by default for rental lots and all lots your household doesn't own. It is also set by default for the Deluxe thermostat.
- Automatic can be shut off by changing the thermostat to any other setting.

### ENERGY EFFICIENCY MODULE
- The energy efficiency module allows the thermostat to run more efficiently, decreasing energy usage. It also give the lot a more green eco footprint.
- Energy usage multipliers are 0.8 for heating and 0.75 for cooling, meaning heating uses 80% of its normal power usage and cooling uses 75% of its normal power usage.
- It requires level 5 handiness, as well as 2 common upgrade parts and 1 electronic upgrade part (or 3 eco upgrade parts if you have Eco Lifestyle).
- This is automatically unlocked for apartments, rental lots, and all lots your household doesn't own.

### CRYTACOO CASING
- The crytacoo casing makes the thermostat unbreakable.
- It requires level 8 handiness, as well as 2 common upgrade parts and 2 electronic upgrade parts (or 4 eco upgrade parts if you have Eco Lifestyle).
- This is automatically unlocked for rental lots and lots your household doesn't own.

### ALL upgrades can be unlocked with cheats.
Turn testingcheats on (press ctrl + shift + C on your keyboard), shift-click (hold shift and left-click) the thermostat, select "Pack Cheats..." then "Upgrades", and click on the upgrade you want to unlock.


## OTHER FEATURES
### Introducing the EcoDisc 51M-5A Deluxe!
The EcoDisc 51M-5A Deluxe is the latest revision of the popular EcoDisc 51M-5. For just 200 simoleons you get all the same features, plus it comes with a temperature sensor pre-installed and is more durable and energy-efficient than the basic model. (It can be found in the gold colored swatches of the original thermostat)

### Thermostats can break with use
- Thermostats now break down over time and can become broken like many other electronics.
- Thermostats will last at least 400 sim hours depending on usage. Heating and cooling decreases durability by 0.25% per hour and AutoOn/Off mode decreases it by 0.1% per hour.
- Broken thermostats can be repaired or replaced.

### New thermostat status indicator textures
- Thermostats that are set to automatic mode will have the bottom half of the status indicator show green while the top half still shows whether the thermostat is off, cooling, or heating as usual.
- Thermostats that are broken will show a red "X" in the status indicator and the button controls will darken.

## Inverted Operation Mode
- Idea by infallible_stonebraker72 on CurseForge
- This mode will swap the heating and cooling for automatic mode and can be used for challenges, hard mode saves, or just for fun.
- To enable it, turn testingcheats on (press ctrl + shift + C on your keyboard), shift-click (hold shift and left-click) the thermostat, then select "Pack Cheats...", "Operations", and "Invert".
- To disable it, turn testingcheats on (press ctrl + shift + C on your keyboard), shift-click (hold shift and left-click) the thermostat, then select "Pack Cheats...", "Operations", and "Normal".

## NOTES
- Translations are made using Google Translate and may not be accurate. Please let me know if there are any issues.
- The automatic mode is inspired by LittleMsSam's automatic thermostat mod.
- This mod currently contains a temporary fix for the following bugs in the thermostat's power usage: New Thermostats Do Not Use Power When Set To Cool, Thermostat Power Usage Gets Permanently Set When Changed To Warm, Thermostats Do Not Change Power Usage Depending On The Season. As such, it is releasing as version 0.9.0 and not 1.0.0, which will be released once these issues are officially resolved.
- There is a Thermostat Fix Only version in optional files if you would just like a patch for the bugs mentioned above.
- MD5 checksum listed in file details.

## MOD/CC COMPATIBILITY
This mod has NOT been tested with any other thermostat mods or CC thermostats and I can't guarantee compatibility. However, if the mod/CC does not override the base game object tuning for thermostats, it SHOULD be compatible. Additionally any CC thermostats that use the base game object tuning for thermostats and do not override it MAY become upgradeable as well, but they will NOT have the thermostat status indicator feature or a deluxe variation.

**Please let me know if there are any issues or you have suggestions, and thank you for checking out my mod!**

Please refer to Nexus Mods or CurseForge pages for the most up-to-date TS4 versions and DLC that have been tested.
